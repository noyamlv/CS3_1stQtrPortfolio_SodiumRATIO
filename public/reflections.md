# List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.
1. A **loop control structure** is a fundamental programming concept that lets you execute a block of code repeatedly. These structures, like as 'for' and 'while' loops, are used to automate repetitive tasks and iterate over collections of data.
2. A **function** is a reusable block of code used to perform a specific task. By using functions, you can organize your code into logical units, making your programs easier to read, maintain, and use.
3. A **control statement** is a building block of a program's logic, enabling you to control the flow of execution based on specific conditions. Without them, a program would execute every line of code sequentially from top to bottom. (ex. if, else, else if)
4. **Arithmetic statements** are used, in the name, for arithmetics and are used as a set of operators to carry out operations. Examples of these are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
5. **Comparison statements** are used, in the name, to compare variables or numbers against each other. Or in better words, it evaluates a relationship between two values, returning a true or false result.

^^ All of these topics are stuff we already discussed in Grade 8, C++ version though!!

# List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why. The why should be per topic listed.
1. **Functions.** Okay, I know I said I knew functions very well, but I feel like I need more practice on it, especially since it's one of the most used things in coding (whether it may be JS or C++). I can describe this topic, but I think there's so much to it that I can practice much more.
2. **Arrays.** Arrays are genuinely so confusing to me, ever since it was introduced to me in Grade 8. I used to think that it was just a list, but there are so many other things you can do with arrays to better utilize them. I need A LOOOT more practice on this.
3. **Event Handlers.** These are actually sooo confusing, because there are so many of them, along with those other built in functions that Javascript has which will do the code for you already (Thank you Javascript but I still gotta learn all of that...)!! It's okay though, I just need to get more used to them and I think I'll be fine :D
4. **Whatever the stuff after Number is:** const NUM = Number(input.toString().trim()) Like... What is that. Yes, I made this code, but I dispose information in my head super easily... Which is why I need more practice on things that include these type of things!!
5. **Whatever this is... (From 7th graded exercise)** (`${isNaN(num) ? "NaN" : num} has no value`) My friend explained this when I was doing it and she told me it was something about selecting an option or something. Still confusing, and this graded exercise reminded me of my Grade 8 CS trauma I was trying to heal from......

# Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.
* I think what I'll do is practice my coding skills a lot more! I find coding fun anyway, so I don't think it'll be much of a struggle for me :D Though the tedious thing about this is having to practice more huhuhu.. As a Grade 9 student in Pisay, it will be hard to find the time. Though, the graded exercises would be a big help as a way to practice these things!

# In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?
**Effective**
1. The graded exercises!! They help me practice my skills and see what I'm still lacking in.
2. In class exercises where we follow along :D It's also easier to ask questions as you do it!!
**Not as Effective**
1. That gambling your life on bonus thingy exercise... All it did was make me scared #4LIFE. THOUGH maybe being scared could make me do SOMETHING right...
2. Discussions.. (I am GUILTY.) For me, at least, because I get distracted super easily and the aircon being directly at my spot make me sleepy!!
